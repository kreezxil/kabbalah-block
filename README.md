# kabbalah-block

## Based on God Block

In this pack you are GOD having just arrived in a newly created universe. Around you there is nothing. You can harvest the nothing to produce all kinds of matter both living and not. The method by which you make matter is by arranging the letters of the Alephbet into words. The words will create results that you can immediately use in your world. For instance to produce a dog you would use the letters כלב which are read right to left. These particular letters are Kaph, Lamed, Bet. Kelab. It means dog. Labrador Retrievers share a root in common with this word.

The purpose of the pack is not to expose you to nikkud which is known as Hebrew vowel points. That would be just way too many characters for me to craft and possibly a level of difficulty that might exceed that of GregTech.

The recipes for the items you can make will be in the JEI. As you can tell the recipes are actually words, real words. If you don't want to learn Hebrew, don't play this pack. However, I don't think this will be a major hurdle for you. In fact I think you will enjoy it.

At some point you will be able to build compressed nothingness which will yield an insane quantity of nothingness that can be harvested for all the letters you will need to craft your universe.
